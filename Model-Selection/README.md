# Evidence Function and Model Selection

## Why "Evidence" called "Evidence"
Evidence function
prediction function

## Model Selection / Model Comparison

### What is "Model" ?

### Bayesian Model comparison

> As we shall see, the over-fitting associated with maximum likelihood can be avoided by marginalizing (summing or integrating) over the model parameters instead of making point estimates of their values. Models can then be compared directly on the training data, without the need for a validation set. This allows all available data to be used for training and avoids the multiple training runs for each model associated with cross-validation.

### Ways To Do Selection

### Over-fitting
> Bayesian framework avoids the problem of over-fitting and allows models to be compared on the basis of the training data alone.
