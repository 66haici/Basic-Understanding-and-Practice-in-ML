## Model Selection

> As we shall see, the over-fitting associated with maximum likelihood can be avoided by marginalizing (summing or integrating) over the model parameters instead of making point estimates of their values. Models can then be compared directly on the training data, without the need for a validation set. This allows all available data to be used for training and avoids the multiple training runs for each model associated with cross-validation.
