# Variational Inference
## Function, Function, Variantion and Variantional methods
Although these is nothing intrsinsically approximate about variational methods, they do naturally lend themselves to finding approximate solutions
## Probabilistic inference
## Variational Inference
Given that posteria distributions are usually intrivial to Variational inference uses analytical method to do probabilistic inference, by
